# To Be a Mother
Date: 2025-10-04

*Dedicated to: my mother Susan*

&nbsp;

To be a mother is to be human

To sometimes fail to connect to your child, no matter how hard you try

To fuck things up, even when your intentions are pure

To try too hard, to care too much -- pushing away your child in the process

&nbsp;

To be a mother is to be nurturing

To share your most cherished moments, to help your child understand

To gift your favorite music, to have it become your child's favorite, too

To teach, to understand, and to forgive

&nbsp;

To be a mother is hard

To be underappreciated

To be overburdened

To try your best, even if it's not enough

&nbsp;

To be a mother is everything

To find a new purpose in life, for worse and for better

To have your child be your whole world, but for it to take them time to understand, if they ever truly do

To watch your child grow, knowing they'll make their own mistakes and learn things in their own time

&nbsp;

To be a child is to grow up

To obey your mother, and break her rules

To eventually understand, and see her as human

To appreciate her care, and to forgive her mistakes

&nbsp;

And to one day repeat the cycle, doing your best to learn from both her successes and mistakes ❤️
